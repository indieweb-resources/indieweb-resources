VC-funded startups made it easy for anybody to maintain a presence online, regardless of skill or training, but this came at a cost. Their business model almost always involves tracking you across the internet, in order to target you with ads, and that ease of use also came with lock-in to their platforms. Even when you can take your information with you, there's not much the average person can actually *do* with it.

Existing resources for people who want to detach their online presence from giant corporations and hateful billionaire trolls are lacking. 

Let's see if we can make something useful and nice â€” *for everyone*.
